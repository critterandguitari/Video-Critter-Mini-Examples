To compile the program (load.c to load.hex), use:

$ make

To program the AVR:

$ make load

'make load' attempts to program the AVR with the command in the Makefile.  This will probably have to be changed depending on what system and programmer you are using.

We used avr-gcc version 3.4.3 to compile, and it should work with other versions of avr-gcc.  If you are having trouble, a pre-compiled version is provided (CA-Synth.hex).  To try the precompiled version use:

$ make pre
